# Setting Up VMware For Anti-Anti-VM :)

### Obvious First Steps:
- Install VMware Workstation Pro
- Create New Virtual Machine
  
### Wizard Settings:
- Hardware Compatibility -> ``Workstation 17+``
- Guest Operating System Installation -> ``Later``
- Guest Operating System -> Windows -> ``Windows 7 (Or Above)``
- Name The Virtual Machine -> ``Windows Whatever``
- Location -> ``Anywhere`` (This will be where your VMX is located)
- Processor Configuration -> ``1 Processor and 4 Cores``
- Memory -> ``8+gb``
- Network Connection -> ``NAT``
- I/O Controller Type -> ``LSI Logic SAS``
- Disk Type -> ``SCSI``
- Select Disk -> ``New Virtual``
- Disk Capacity -> ``128-256gb`` -> ``Split Into Multiple Files``
- Disk File -> ``Whatever``
- Finish!

## VM Settings (Hardware Tab):

- Virtualization Engine -> ``Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI`` (Disable Your HV if using Windows Sandbox with the command: ``bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off``)
- CD/DVD(SATA) -> Use ISO Image File -> ``Your Windows ISO``
- Network Adapter -> Advanced Settings -> MAC Address -> Change to ``FC:34:97:13:33:37`` (Anything Other Than VMware Owned Addresses - Don't Click Generate) 

## VM Settings (Options Tab):

- Advanced -> Firmware Type -> ``BIOS``

## BIOS
Customise your BIOS ROM with ``Phoenix BIOS Editor`` using XP SP2 Compatibility Mode (Or use my pre-supplied one from this project):

## ACPI and WAET
The WAET (Windows ACPI Emulated Devices Table) is a Microsoft-specific ACPI table that provides performance hints to Windows when running in a virtualized environment. It tells the OS to optimize things like timer usage and device emulation for a hypervisor.
Its presence is a strong indicator the system is a VM, since physical hardware does not include WAET â€” it only exists to help Windows perform better on virtual machines.

So the solution then is to remove WAET entirely or rename its OEM ID. I suggest removing it and renaming the rest of the ACPI entries - they will be different for everybody depending on their setup.

Add my ``ACPI_Cevapi.dat`` or ``ACPI_Cevapi_No_WAET.dat`` to your VMX if you want to add this feature. 

Note that my ACPI only renames ``WAET``, ``HPET`` and ``SRAT``, if you want rename more entries you will need to do that yourself or add the extra entries to the ``acpi.skiptables`` command instead.

## Customising the .VMX file:
Add the following to your project's VMX file which is located where you've saved the virtual disk data.
```
monitor_control.restrict_backdoor = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_directexec = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_chksimd = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_selfmod = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_ntreloc = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_reloc = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btmemspace = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btpriv = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btinout = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btseg = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.getVersion.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.setVersion.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.getPtrLocation.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.setPtrLocation.disable = "TRUE"
hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = "FALSE"
board-id.reflectHost = "TRUE"
hw.model.reflectHost = "TRUE"
serialNumber.reflectHost = "TRUE"
smbios.reflectHost = "TRUE"
SMBIOS.noOEMStrings = "TRUE"
scsi0:0.productID = "Cevapi5000"
scsi0:0.vendorID = "Cevapi"
bios440.filename = "C:\<Whatever>\BIOS.440_Cevapi.ROM"
acpi.skiptables = "WAET,HPET,SRAT,APIC,MCFG,WSMT,SKIP"
acpi.addtable.filename = "C:\<Whatever>\ACPI_Cevapi_No_WAET.dat"
```

## VMware Hardened Loader

This is a very useful tool against VMProtect so I highly suggest using it.

All you have to do is download the ``install.bat``, ``uninstall.bat`` and ``vmloader.sys`` from the ![project's bin folder](https://github.com/hzqst/VmwareHardenedLoader/tree/master/bin) and run it on the VM.

It appears to work on Windows 7 and above.

## Done!

Enjoy your VMProtect, Themida or whatever application!
